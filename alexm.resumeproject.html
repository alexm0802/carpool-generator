		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>I am a coxswain for the Lakeside Men's Crew Team. This primarily involves yelling at sweaty boys. I do this five to six times a week, pretty much year-round. Why? Because there's nothing better than steering a straight course across flat water while your boat is rowing well, and every practice helps us get there. Our motto? "Row Fast, Don't Suck". </p>

				<p class="list-item-text">I won a race in October 2015, and then got thrown in the slough as a "reward". The "coxswain toss" is a tradition in rowing. <a href = "http://novicerow.blogspot.com/2011/04/tradition-of-toss.html">Learn more</a> about this here. </p>

				<p> I learned how to censor audio, so this coxswain recording of me at Head of the Snohomish 2015 is actually school-appropriate. </p>
